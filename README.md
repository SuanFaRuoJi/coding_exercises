# README
## Introduction
This repo is created by 鞠承佑[:email:](chengyou0421@gmail.com), 钟恺健[:email:](.comkzhong.97@gmail), 王少泽[:email:](shaozewxy@gmail.com). It is managed under the account SuanFaRuoji(算法弱鸡)[:email:](SuanFaRuoJi@gmail.com), which can be accessed by all three creators.

The purpose of this repo is to store and share the coding problems encounter by us so as to imrpove ourselves in coding and problem-solving skills.

## Naming Conventions
Under the root, folders for different problem sources should be created using lower\_snake\_case. Folders for leetcode and poj have already been created. Should a new source appear, its folder should look like
```
new_source
```

In each source folder, create a folder for each problem using lower\_snake\_case, and in that folder, add submission identified by username abbreviation and language used. As an example, say 钟恺健 finished problem 889 in leetcode using Python, then the folder structure would look like this:
```
root
└──leetcode
   └──889_construct_binary_tree_from_preorder_and_postorder_traversal
      └──zkj_python.py
```
